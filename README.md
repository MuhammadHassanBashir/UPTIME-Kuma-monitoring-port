# UPTIME-Kuma-monitoring-port
With Uptime Kuma, we can monitor container ports and send notifications to the client whenever a container port goes up or down

    My Uptime Kuma containers are running on the server, and it is configured to monitor the ports of both the remote server and the localhost where my container is running. If the port goes down, it sends a notification to a specific notification channel. I am sending notifications to Snappy, but we can also send notifications to email (SMTP) and multiple other destinations.
